# TryHackMe – Content Discovery Notes

## 📌 Introduction

In web application security, **content** can include:
- Files
- Images / Videos
- Backup files
- Config files
- Admin panels
- Staff portals
- Old versions of websites

**Content Discovery** = Finding hidden or unlinked resources that are not directly visible and may not be intended for public access.

### Three Main Methods:
1. Manual
2. Automated
3. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)

---

## 🧭 Manual Discovery

### 1️⃣ robots.txt
Location: 
- Tells search engines what not to crawl
- Does NOT restrict access
- May expose:
  - `/admin/`
  - `/backup/`
  - `/internal/`

---

### 2️⃣ Favicon
Location:
- Small browser tab icon
- Can be hashed and fingerprinted
- Helps identify:
  - CMS
  - Framework
  - Backend tech

---

### 3️⃣ sitemap.xml
Location:
- Lists site URLs for search engines
- May reveal:
  - Hidden pages
  - Old endpoints
  - Staging URLs
  - Admin paths

---

### 4️⃣ HTTP Headers

View via:
- Browser DevTools → Network
- `curl -I <url>`

Important headers:
- `Server`
- `X-Powered-By`
- `Set-Cookie`
- `Content-Security-Policy`

Used for:
- Tech stack identification
- Detecting misconfigurations

---

### 5️⃣ Framework Stack Identification

Clues:
- `/wp-admin` → WordPress
- `.php` → PHP
- `.aspx` → ASP.NET
- `/static/` → Django

Purpose:
- Identify technologies
- Research known vulnerabilities

---

## 🤖 Automated Discovery

Uses wordlists to brute-force directories/files.

Common Tools:
- gobuster
- dirb
- ffuf
- dirsearch

Finds:
- Hidden directories
- Backup files
- Unlinked endpoints

---

## 🔎 OSINT Techniques

### 1️⃣ Google Dorking

Operators:
- `site:`
- `filetype:`
- `intitle:`
- `inurl:`

Examples:
Finds:
- Exposed files
- Login portals
- Open directories

---

### 2️⃣ Wappalyzer

- Browser extension
- Detects:
  - CMS
  - Frameworks
  - Analytics
  - Programming languages

Used for tech fingerprinting.

---

### 3️⃣ Wayback Machine

Website:
Used to find:
- Old versions
- Removed pages
- Deprecated endpoints
- Previously exposed content

---

### 4️⃣ GitHub OSINT

Search for:
May reveal:
- API keys
- Hardcoded credentials
- Source code leaks
- Config files

---

## 🔐 Key Takeaways

- Always check: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, headers
- Combine Manual + Automated + OSINT
- Tech fingerprinting improves attack strategy
- Many breaches start with simple content discovery

### Finshed the room - Subdomain Enumeration

Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain, but why do we do this? We do this to expand our attack surface to try and discover more potential points of vulnerability.

We will explore three different subdomain enumeration methods: Brute Force, OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and Virtual Host.

# Learned about:
- OSINT - SSL/TLS certificates
- OSINT Search Engines
- DNS brute force
